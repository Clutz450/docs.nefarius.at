# Welcome to Version 3 Beta Testing

Ahoy there! ðŸ‘‹ If you can read this you're most probably part of the DsHidMini Version 3 Beta crew, welcome!

Please read this article thoroughly before continuing to use the software or asking questions about it.

## Participation rules

The dev team is small, like, *really* small, so we have no time for any BS. If you want to help us find and fix bugs, some rules are inevitable or the ride won't be any fun.

TBD

## Important facts

- The mandatory redirect to this page will **NOT** be removed until a stable public release becomes available.
- The documentation on this site is **still written for version 2** and some sections might no longer apply to version 3.
- Version 3 uses a completely different configuration system so the old `DSHMC.exe` **can not be used with version 3**.
- The `igfilter` version `v1.1.0.0` copy shipped with DsHidMini version 2 **does not work with version 3** and needs to be updated to *at least* `v1.1.1.0` or newer.
