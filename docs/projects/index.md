# About Projects

Welcome! 👋

Here you can find an overview over past and actively maintained projects under the wings of the Nefarius ecosystem 😁

Most of them - if they're open-source - you'll find on GitHub primarily; these sites here are meant to provide extended user documentation (less developer-heavy), a bit of history insights for discontinued projects and announcements or in-progress information for solutions currently cooking in the labs 😎

Bear in mind that this is not a complete list of my creations, check out my repositories on [GitHub](https://github.com/nefarius?tab=repositories) and [self-hosted](https://git.nefarius.at/nefarius).
