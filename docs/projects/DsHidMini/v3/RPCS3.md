### Prerequisites:  
- You have an official PS3 Controller.  
- DsHidMini v3 (and optionally BthPS3) has been installed and controller verified working per the installation instructions [here](How-to-Install.md).  
- RPCS3 emulator is installed and working properly. (Quickstart guide located [here](https://rpcs3.net/quickstart)).  
  
!!! note "NOTE"
    If you don't change any of the default settings of DsHidMini, your PS3 controller will still work and be able to be mapped as a controller in RPCS3. However, you will not have use of the extra features that the controller has, such as motion controls or pressure sensitive buttons. Follow the steps below to enable these features.
