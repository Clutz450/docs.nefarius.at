# End of Life Statement

In May 2023 a conflict with a registered trademark by ViGEM GmbH was discovered, leading to a mutual agreement between Nefarius Software Solutions e.U. and ViGEM GmbH to enter a transition phase starting July 2023 and ending approximately December 2023. As a result of the agreement, all usage of the phrase "ViGEm" (ViGEmBus etc.) and the Domain `vigem.org` will be retired and archived permanently over the agreed upon time span.

As a direct result the ViGEmBus project will no longer receive any updates and has been archived/retired.

**This has no impact on existing installations except for the updater components: their auto-updaters need to be adjusted to prevent a potential security risk!** (More info on the next section)

So long, everyone, it was fun while it lasted ðŸ˜„

## Adjusting the Automatic Updater Configuration

Software like ViGEmBus, HidHide and older versions of BthPS3 got shipped with an auto-updater service which periodically establishes communication with a web service hosted under `updates.vigem.org`. This service will be permanently retired after December 2023, therefore it is highly recommended to adjust their configuration so they contact the new update server from now on.

**If the updaters are not adjusted, they will continue to contact the old domain, which could lead to your public IP address getting leaked to whoever has the ownership of the domain starting from 2024.**

There are two ways of adjusting the updaters:

1. Using the Legacinator tool to automatically update them. Quick and easy!
2. Manually adjusting the configuration file for each updater

### Automatic method: using Legacinator

1. Download and execute the latest version of the [Legacinator tool](https://github.com/nefarius/Legacinator/releases)
2. Look for the "Outdated XXXXXXX Updater Configuration found" option
    - There can be up to 3 of them: one for the ViGEmBus, another for HidHide and the last one for BthPS3  
  ![legacinator-outdated-updater-config.png](images/legacinator-outdated-updater-config.png)
3. Select the options regarding the outdated configuration
4. Done! Updaters configuration adjusted!
5. Close the Legacinator window and the updater popup will close as well

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I trust this?

This site, the software, drivers and other products mentioned here and their updaters are all under the [Nefarius](https://euipo.europa.eu/eSearch/#details/trademarks/018878323) brand, from the developer named Benjamin HÃ¶glinger-Stelzer, A.K.A. Nefarius. You can check [his github profile link here](https://github.com/nefarius). The warning in the updaters are legit if they match what is being described in this page.

### Why does this update look and feel a bit sketchy?

The updater agent is a 3rd party product, there were only very limited options available in attempting to turn it into an "important news delivery tool". The end result was as good as we could make it ðŸ˜…

### What will happen to the ViGEmBus and related products?

All archived/discontinued projects will remain available and the actively maintained ones will continue being supported, but now under the Nefarius brand name.

### Do I need to care about adjusting the updaters if I don't care about updates?

It's highly recommended to do so in order to prevent the security risk described in the "Adjusting the Automatic Updater Configuration" section.

### This update is taking forever, the progress doesn't finish

After you hit "Next", you need to close the pink Legacinator window when done with it, then the updater will run to completion.
