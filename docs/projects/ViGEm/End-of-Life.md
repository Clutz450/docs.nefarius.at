# End of Life Statement

In May 2023 a conflict with a registered trademark by [ViGEM GmbH](https://vigem.de/) was discovered, leading to a mutual agreement between Nefarius Software Solutions e.U. and ViGEM GmbH to enter a transition phase starting July 2023 and ending approximately December 2023. As a result of the agreement, all usage of the phrase "ViGEm" (ViGemBus etc.) and the Domain `vigem.org` will be retired and archived permanently over the agreed upon time span.

Software like ViGEmBus, HidHide and older versions of BthPS3 got shipped with an auto-updater service which periodically establishes communication with a web service hosted under `updates.vigem.org`. **This service will be permanently retired after December 2023**, therefore it is highly recommended to follow the outlined procedures of this article to stop your installation making any further web requests to the to-be-decommissioned web service.

So long, everyone, it was fun while it lasted ðŸ˜„

## Adjust Automatic Updater Configuration

The software packages mentioned below ship with an automatic updater agent, a little program that runs once a day and contacts a web service configured in a shipped INI configuration file. The updater process is launched via scheduled tasks.

### Configure ViGEm Bus Driver Updater

    If you're running ViGEm Bus Driver **v1.21.442 or older** the following section applies to you and is highly recommended to follow until software updates become available (if ever).

Navigate to the path `C:\Program Files\Nefarius Software Solutions\ViGEm Bus Driver` and edit the file `ViGEmBus_Updater.ini` with a text editor of your choice (you will need Administrator permissions to edit). Find the following line:

```

Change it to:

```ini

Save it an you're done! From now on the updater agent will contact the new server to check for software updates.
