Nefarius' [nŏvīcĭus](https://latinitium.com/latin-dictionaries/?t=lsn31290) is a universal software updater agent for Windows. It's a self-contained executable that can be shipped alongside your software product(s) and takes care of keeping them up-to-date out in the field. It requires only minimal configuration and backend server capabilities (any static web server will do) while offering enough flexibility and optional features to the more adventurous users.

On this site you can find the extended documentation teaching you how to get it up and running in a few moments.

## Architecture

The only requirement you need to *at least* fulfil is to provide a web server providing the remote update configuration file.
