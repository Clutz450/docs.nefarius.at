ViGEm or more commonly known as ViGEmBus was a redistributable framework for Windows, consisting of a kernel driver and user-mode library for C/C++, .NET and various other community-provided bindings. Its purpose was to provide the developer with a software-equivalent of the popular Microsoft™ Xbox 360 and Sony™ DualShock 4 Controller and feed their inputs via an API. This enabled pretty much any application to emulate commonly known virtual game controller devices for whatever purpose envisioned by the author.

It was in development from August 2017 to August 2023 until it got [archived due to a trademark conflict](End-of-Life.md). A direct successor is in the works in the lab but not yet released.
